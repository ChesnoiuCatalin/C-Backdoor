# C-Backdoor
This C code creates a backdoor on Windows machines, enabling a remote user to access, control, and monitor the device. It includes functions to execute shell commands, create a registry entry to enable autorun, and a keylogger to log the user's keystrokes. It also hides the malicious activity by hiding the console window.
